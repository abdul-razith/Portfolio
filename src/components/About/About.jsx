                    <p>Hey! I'm Abdul Rahman, I've been close to a computer since an early age, and been passionate about it ever since.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>I really liked to build stuff using no-code tools
                        back in 2010, and from that, I explored how to code myself, fast-forward to today, I do programming in various languages and technologies, and had the privilege to worked in a Recruitment Company
                        and a SaaS Company
                        I'm interested in building something awesome with code and automate tasks with code, currently focused on Web & Mobile Development,
                        Open Source
                        and Competitive Programming</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>When I'm not coding I play games with my friends, watch some show on Netflix, or if the weather's good, play basketball! üèÄ</p>
